# Overview  

As a software engineer, I created this project to learn TypeScript, and its unique syntax, and its benefits over JavaScript. This program demonstrates TypeScript's capabilities, including static typing, interfaces, and classes, to build a functional application.  

The software I wrote is a **task management application** where users can create, view, and update tasks. It utilizes TypeScript's type system to ensure the reliability and scalability of the codebase.  

The purpose of this project was to improve my skills in TypeScript while learning how to integrate its advanced features into real-world applications.

# Development Environment  

I used the following tools to develop the software:  
- **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor.  
- **Node.js** to run the TypeScript code.  
- **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)** to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript.  


# Useful Websites  

Here are some resources that were helpful during the project:  
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)  
- [JavaScript Info: TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-tutorial)
- [Inquirer.js Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

# Future Work  

To improve and expand the application, I plan to:  
- Add **persistent storage** using a database or local file system.  
- Implement **user authentication** for multiple users.  
- Build a **web-based interface** using React and TypeScript for better usability.
